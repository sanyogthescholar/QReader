# QReader, an app to read QR Codes from your Windows device
Copy an image to clipboard, press Ctrl + Shift + Q and the QR code is scanned!
The result can be pasted in any text field

Features:
- Based on [ZXing.net](https://github.com/micjahn/ZXing.Net)
- Supports only QR codes at the moment
- WIP to make the application minimize to tray
- Fully FOSS, no internet connection needed
